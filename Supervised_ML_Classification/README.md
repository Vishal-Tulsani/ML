## Classification predicts the a category the data belongs to.
eg: Spam Detection, Churn Prediction, Sentiment Analysis,Dog Breed Detection.

## Regression predicts a numerical value based on previous observed data.
eg: House Price Prediction, Stock Price Prediction, Height-Weight Prediction.

## Classification
Classification is a technique for determining class the dependent belongs to based on the one or more independent variables.
                    
    Classification is used for predicting discrete responses.

### Applications of Classification are: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, biometric identification, document classification etc.
Classifiers can be:

### Binary classifiers: 
#### Classification with only 2 distinct classes or with 2 possible outcomes
example: Male and Female
example: classification of spam email and non spam email
example: classification of author of book
example: positive and negative sentiment

#### Multi-Class classifiers: Classification with more than two distinct classes.
example: classification of types of soil
example: classification of types of crops
example: classification of mood/feelings in songs/music
#### 1). Naive Bayes (Classifier):
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes theorem. Under a simple assumption which is the attributes are conditionally independent.
